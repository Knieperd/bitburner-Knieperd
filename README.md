Repo for my bitburner scripts. Feel free to use them

## Stock.js
Stock.js is a script that automaticly uses the stock market to gain money. The more money you allow it to use, the more money it will make for you.


### how to use
run it in your terminal with the following prompt:
run stock.js args[0] args[1]
- args[0] = The minimum amount of money you want it to bail out. (Put this above 1t if you don't want to use it, it might yield more profit not using it)
- args[1] = Amount of money you want to keep on your bank. (Put this above 100.000.000)


## SoonTM.js
More to be added soon ;)
